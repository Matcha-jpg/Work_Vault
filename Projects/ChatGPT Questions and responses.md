# Multiple routes on sdwan config
Question: when setting up sdwan routes on Cisco SDWAN Edge routers, would having multiple routes such as: ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 x.x.x.x for each WAN facing interface be an issue?

###### ChatGPT said:

Yes, having **multiple `ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0` (default routes)** pointing to different WAN interfaces **on Cisco SD-WAN (Viptela)** edge routers is not inherently an issue, **if configured properly**. In fact, it's a **common practice** in SD-WAN to support **multiple WAN transport paths**, such as internet, MPLS, and LTE.

However, **how these routes are interpreted and used** depends on **how SD-WAN policies and configurations are set up**, particularly:

---

### ‚úÖ When it's **NOT** an issue:

If your configuration is **intentional and controlled**, then multiple default routes are fine:

1. **Equal-cost routes**:
    
    - If multiple `0.0.0.0/0` routes have the **same administrative distance and metric**, they will be treated as **equal-cost multipath (ECMP)** routes.
        
    - SD-WAN can load-balance traffic across these paths (depending on the policy).
        
2. **SD-WAN Transport Interface Configuration**:
    
    - In Cisco SD-WAN, WAN interfaces are typically configured under `vpn 0`, and control connections (to vSmart, vBond, vManage) are built over these interfaces.
        
    - Default routes may be needed for the device to **reach the control plane (DTLS/TLS tunnels)** over each transport.
        
3. **TLOC & BFD Probes**:
    
    - Cisco SD-WAN doesn't rely only on static routing. It uses **TLOCs** (Transport Locators) and **BFD** to monitor paths and make real-time decisions.
        
    - Having multiple default routes enables **TLOCs to register** via each WAN link.
        

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è When it **CAN** be an issue:

1. **Incorrect priorities / Administrative Distance**:
    
    - If one default route is meant to be primary but you don't adjust the **AD (administrative distance)** or metric, the router may use the "wrong" route.
        
2. **Lack of Policy Control**:
    
    - Without **centralized or localized policy**, traffic could go over unintended links, especially if **data-policy or app-route-policy** is not applied.
        
3. **Overlapping or Conflicting Static Routes**:
    
    - If you're using **manual static routes** instead of relying on SD-WAN's automatic TLOC-based routing, and they conflict or loop, it could break connectivity.
        
4. **NAT/Firewall Asymmetry**:
    
    - If a session enters via one WAN and exits via another, it could break due to **NAT or firewall state tracking**.
        

---

### ‚úÖ Best Practices:

- Use **SD-WAN centralized policies** to control **traffic direction, failover, and application-aware routing**.
    
- Let **OMP (Overlay Management Protocol)** handle most of the routing through TLOC advertisements and route propagation.
    
- Only configure multiple static default routes if you:
    
    - Want to provide failover or ECMP.
        
    - Have configured **tracking** or **BFD-based path monitoring**.
        
    - Understand how SD-WAN fabric handles **control and data plane routing**.
        

---

### üìå Example:

`ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.0.2.1 ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 198.51.100.1`

This would be valid if `192.0.2.1` and `198.51.100.1` are gateways on two different WAN interfaces (e.g., internet and MPLS), and your policies or TLOCs support them.

---

### Final Note:

In **Cisco SD-WAN**, the **overlay fabric** handles most routing dynamically via **OMP**, and static default routes are often just used to reach **underlay next hops** (for tunnel initiation). So, multiple static default routes are **fine and even recommended**‚Äîas long as you understand **how the SD-WAN handles transport routing and policy application**.

If you're seeing unexpected behavior, consider using `show ip route`, `show control connections`, and `show sdwan bfd sessions` to diagnose path selection.

# Onboard Physical Router
in vManage, I have a list of WAN Edges each with their own Chassis Number. These are all Virtualized edges yes? If so, how would I join a physical edge with its own Chassis and Token with my SDWAN, and could I safely reset it to factory defaults?

###### ChatGPT said:

Yes, let‚Äôs break this down step-by-step.

---

### ‚úÖ **1. vManage and Chassis Numbers ‚Äì Are these virtualized WAN Edges?**

In **vManage**, the Chassis Number identifies each WAN Edge device. These could be:

- **vEdge Cloud (virtualized WAN Edges)** ‚Äì most commonly used in virtual environments (e.g., AWS, Azure, VMware).
    
- **vEdge/cEdge Physical devices** ‚Äì physical routers (like ISR, ASR, or ENCS running SD-WAN).
    

> So, **just having a Chassis Number doesn't necessarily mean the device is virtual.** You‚Äôll need to check the **model number** or **platform type** in vManage to confirm whether it's a **virtual** or **physical** edge.

---

### ‚úÖ **2. How do I onboard a **physical** WAN Edge device into my SD-WAN fabric?**

To join a physical WAN Edge to your SD-WAN network, you typically use a process called **Controller/Plug-and-Play onboarding**. Here's how:

#### üî∑ Step-by-Step ‚Äì Onboarding a Physical WAN Edge:

1. **Obtain the Chassis Number & Serial Number**:
    
    - These are on a sticker on the physical device, or can be seen in the boot log/CLI.
        
    - You'll need them to generate a **Bootstrap Configuration / Token**.
        
2. **Add the Device to vManage**:
    
    - Go to `Configuration > Devices > WAN Edge List`.
        
    - Click **"Add WAN Edge"**.
        
    - Enter the Chassis Number and Serial Number of the physical device.
        
    - vManage will generate a **.viptela license file** or **Bootstrap configuration**.
        
3. **Install the Token / Bootstrap Config on the Device**:
    
    - Console into the physical device.
        
    - Apply the token using a command like:
        
        `request platform software sdwan vedge-cloud activate chassis-number <chassis#> token <token>`
        
    - Or copy over the **Bootstrap config file** to the device via USB or SCP.
        
4. **Connectivity**:
    
    - The device must be able to reach **vBond**, **vSmart**, and **vManage**.
        
    - After successful validation, it will appear as a **"validated"** device in vManage and you can assign it a full configuration template.
        

---

### ‚úÖ **3. Can I safely reset the physical WAN Edge to factory defaults?**

**Yes, but consider these first:**

#### üîπ Use `request software reset` for Factory Reset:

- For **vEdge devices**, use:
    
    `request system erase`
    
    or
    
    `request software reset`
    
- For **cEdge (IOS XE SD-WAN)** devices, use:
    
    `write erase reload`
    

#### üîπ Things to consider before resetting:

- **Back up any existing config** (if needed).
    
- Make sure you still have access to the **Bootstrap token or configuration**.
    
- A factory reset will erase:
    
    - All configurations
        
    - Certificates
        
    - Device identity and logs
        

After reset, the device will be in a **"ZTP" state** and can be re-onboarded as if new.

---

### üìù Summary:

|Question|Answer|
|---|---|
|Are devices in vManage with Chassis Numbers virtual?|Not always ‚Äì check the model type.|
|How to onboard a physical WAN Edge?|Add to WAN Edge List ‚Üí Apply Token or Bootstrap ‚Üí Ensure connectivity to controllers.|
|Can I safely reset a physical WAN Edge?|Yes, with proper backups and token/config in hand.|

If you'd like, I can walk you through generating a token or verifying the device type in your vManage UI. Just let me know what you see under `Configuration > Devices`.
# BWAN!
what is BWAN?

###### ChatGPT said:

The acronym **BWAN** can have several different meanings depending on the context. Some of the most common ones are:

- ‚ÄúBroadband Wireless Access Network‚Äù ‚Äî referring to a wireless network architecture for broadband access. [Acronym Finder+2Acronym Finder+2](https://www.acronymfinder.com/Broadband-Wireless-Access-Network-%28BWAN%29.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- ‚ÄúBlog Writers and Artists Network‚Äù ‚Äî as in a community or network of creators. [Acronym Finder+1](https://www.acronymfinder.com/Blog-Writers-and-Artists-Network-%28BWAN%29.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- ‚ÄúBureau Wide Area Network‚Äù ‚Äî another more generic IT/networking expansion. [The Free Dictionary+1](https://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/BWAN?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

If you tell me **which context** you encountered ‚ÄúBWAN‚Äù (e.g., telecommunications, a blog/forum, corporate IT, etc.), I can check and give **the most likely meaning** for that scenario.

##### You said:

Borderless WAN?

###### ChatGPT said:

Ah ‚Äî yes, in that context, **BWAN** often refers to **Borderless WAN**, a concept or solution architecture used in enterprise networking.

Here‚Äôs what **Borderless WAN (BWAN)** means:

### üîç Definition

**Borderless WAN** is a **network architecture approach** that removes traditional boundaries between data centers, branch offices, cloud services, and remote users. It allows secure, seamless connectivity across multiple network domains ‚Äî regardless of **location, device, or transport medium (MPLS, Internet, 5G, etc.)**.

### üß† Core Idea

It‚Äôs part of Cisco‚Äôs **Borderless Network Architecture**, which aims to give users and devices secure, reliable access to network resources ‚Äúanytime, anywhere.‚Äù

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- **Unified connectivity:** Integrates multiple WAN technologies (MPLS, broadband, LTE/5G, etc.) under a single management layer.
    
- **Security built-in:** Uses secure tunnels, firewalls, and policy enforcement across all edges.
    
- **Application optimization:** Prioritizes critical applications and ensures quality of service (QoS).
    
- **Cloud readiness:** Designed for hybrid and multicloud environments.
    
- **Centralized management:** Often paired with SD-WAN controllers for policy and analytics.
    

### üè¢ Example

A company with offices worldwide can use a **Borderless WAN** to ensure employees can access corporate apps whether they‚Äôre on-site, at home, or connected via cloud ‚Äî all while maintaining consistent performance and security.

So yes ‚Äî **BWAN = Borderless Wide Area Network**, and it‚Äôs essentially a **modern, software-defined evolution of traditional WANs**, built for the cloud era.

Would you like me to compare **BWAN vs SD-WAN**? They‚Äôre closely related but not identical.

##### You said:

so is BWAN a subset of SD WAN?

###### ChatGPT said:

Excellent question ‚Äî and it‚Äôs a subtle one. The short answer is:

> **BWAN (Borderless WAN)** isn‚Äôt exactly a _subset_ of SD-WAN, but rather an **architectural concept** that _includes_ or _can be implemented using_ SD-WAN technologies.

Let‚Äôs unpack that carefully.

---

### üß≠ 1. **Conceptual Scope**

|Aspect|**BWAN (Borderless WAN)**|**SD-WAN (Software-Defined WAN)**|
|---|---|---|
|**Definition**|A _design philosophy_ from Cisco‚Äôs Borderless Network Architecture that focuses on secure, seamless access across network boundaries.|A _technology framework_ that uses software-defined networking (SDN) principles to manage and optimize WAN connections.|
|**Purpose**|Eliminate ‚Äúborders‚Äù between users, devices, and resources (data center, cloud, branch).|Simplify WAN management and improve performance using centralized control and dynamic path selection.|
|**Scope**|Broader ‚Äî includes not just connectivity but also identity, policy, security, and mobility.|More focused ‚Äî on WAN traffic routing, optimization, and orchestration.|

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 2. **Relationship**

You can think of **SD-WAN as an _enabler_ of the Borderless WAN vision**.

- A **BWAN deployment** might _use_ SD-WAN technology as its underlying transport and control layer.
    
- But **BWAN also covers other areas** like end-to-end security, policy enforcement, cloud access, and mobility services ‚Äî all parts of Cisco‚Äôs larger _Borderless Network_ architecture (which also included Borderless Campus, Borderless Data Center, etc.).
    

---

### üß© 3. **Analogy**

If the **Borderless Network** is the _strategy_,  
and the **Borderless WAN** is the _architectural goal_,  
then **SD-WAN** is one of the _tools or implementations_ that helps achieve it.

---

### ‚úÖ **In summary**

- **BWAN** = broader architecture / design philosophy
    
- **SD-WAN** = specific software-defined technology that can implement BWAN principles
    

So you could say:

> ‚ÄúModern Borderless WAN architectures are typically _powered by SD-WAN_ solutions.‚Äù

Would you like a visual diagram comparing their architecture layers?

##### You said:

so if I currently have an SD WAN Fabric, can I integrate BWAN into that?

###### ChatGPT said:

Great, now you‚Äôre asking the _right kind_ of architectural question ‚Äî and the answer is:

> ‚úÖ **Yes**, you _can_ integrate Borderless WAN (BWAN) principles into your existing **SD-WAN fabric**, but it‚Äôs not about _adding_ a new physical component ‚Äî it‚Äôs about _extending your current SD-WAN_ with **borderless capabilities** (security, identity, cloud, mobility, and unified policy).

Let‚Äôs break down what that really means:

---

## üß† 1. SD-WAN vs BWAN in Practice

If you already have an **SD-WAN fabric**, that gives you:

- Centralized policy and control
    
- Application-aware routing
    
- Dynamic path selection (MPLS, broadband, LTE/5G, etc.)
    
- Basic security and segmentation
    

But a **Borderless WAN (BWAN)** goes further by extending those benefits _beyond_ the WAN fabric ‚Äî into the cloud, users, and devices, with unified identity, security, and access control.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. How to Integrate BWAN Capabilities into an SD-WAN Fabric

Here‚Äôs how you‚Äôd ‚Äúevolve‚Äù your SD-WAN into a Borderless WAN architecture:

|BWAN Capability|How to Add/Integrate It|
|---|---|
|**Zero-Trust & Identity-Aware Access**|Integrate **Identity Services Engine (ISE)** or similar for user/device-based policies across WAN edges.|
|**Secure Internet & Cloud Access**|Add **Cloud OnRamp**, **SASE** (Secure Access Service Edge), or **CASB** integrations to extend SD-WAN into cloud edges securely.|
|**Unified Security Policy**|Use **SD-WAN + Secure Firewall** (like Cisco Umbrella or Palo Alto Prisma Access) to enforce consistent policies regardless of location.|
|**Mobility Integration**|Extend WAN policies to mobile/remote users via **VPNaaS** or **ZTP** (Zero-Touch Provisioning).|
|**Automation & Visibility**|Integrate with **Cisco DNA Center**, **vManage**, or **ThousandEyes** for end-to-end visibility, analytics, and automation.|

Essentially, your SD-WAN is the _transport and orchestration layer_, while BWAN principles guide how you unify access, identity, and security _across_ that transport.

---

## üß© 3. Architecture Evolution Example

**Current State:**  
`Branch ‚Üî SD-WAN ‚Üî Data Center/Cloud`

**Target (BWAN-Enabled) State:**  
`User/Device ‚Üî Secure Edge (SASE/Cloud) ‚Üî SD-WAN Fabric ‚Üî Apps (Cloud, Data Center, SaaS)`

Here, the WAN boundaries disappear ‚Äî users securely connect from _anywhere_ with consistent policy and experience.

---

## üß≠ 4. Summary

- You don‚Äôt ‚Äúadd‚Äù BWAN _to_ SD-WAN.
    
- You **extend your SD-WAN** implementation to align with **BWAN principles** ‚Äî security everywhere, unified policy, and seamless connectivity across all edges.
    
- In Cisco terms, it‚Äôs like moving from _SD-WAN_ ‚Üí _SASE + Borderless Network Architecture_.
    

---

Would you like me to outline a **migration roadmap** (step-by-step phases) for evolving an SD-WAN into a Borderless WAN environment?

##### You said:

so is BWAN essentially a kind of wrapper around SD WAN that enables the Fabric to look like a full mesh topology, but have succinct and granular control/security policies at the edges "within" the Fabric?

###### ChatGPT said:

That‚Äôs a _very sharp and accurate interpretation_ ‚Äî and you‚Äôre **90% right** in how you‚Äôre thinking about it. Let‚Äôs refine it just slightly so you can describe it precisely in technical and architectural terms.

---

## üß≠ Short answer

> **Yes ‚Äî BWAN can be thought of as a ‚Äúwrapper‚Äù or higher-level architectural layer around the SD-WAN fabric**, designed to make the network behave _as if it were a seamless, borderless, full-mesh system_ with unified security, control, and policy enforcement at every edge.

But it‚Äôs **not only about topology (mesh)** ‚Äî it‚Äôs equally about **context-aware connectivity**, **identity-based policy**, and **consistent security across all network edges** (branches, cloud, remote users, and data centers).

---

## üß© Deep dive

Here‚Äôs how BWAN ‚Äúwraps‚Äù around the SD-WAN fabric conceptually:

|Layer|Purpose|Technology Enablers|
|---|---|---|
|**BWAN (Architectural Layer)**|Defines the _borderless_ model ‚Äî unified identity, policy, and security across any edge.|Zero-Trust, SASE, Identity Services Engine (ISE), Secure Edge Gateways, Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASB), DNS-layer security, etc.|
|**SD-WAN (Control / Data Plane Fabric)**|Provides dynamic connectivity and transport independence between network endpoints (branch, DC, cloud).|vManage/vSmart, BGP-EVPN, IPSec tunnels, QoS, path selection, segmentation.|
|**Underlay (Transport)**|Physical or virtual links ‚Äî MPLS, broadband, LTE/5G, satellite, etc.|ISP circuits, carrier services.|

So the **BWAN layer** governs _how_ the SD-WAN fabric behaves and interacts with users, devices, and clouds ‚Äî effectively turning your WAN into a **‚Äúlogical borderless mesh‚Äù** where policy follows the user or application, not the link or site.

---

## üï∏Ô∏è Topology perspective

You‚Äôre right to call out the _‚Äúfull-mesh illusion.‚Äù_

- SD-WAN natively can create **dynamic partial- or full-mesh** topologies for optimal pathing.
    
- BWAN extends that by making **all edges (including remote/cloud)** appear as peers in a global policy and trust domain ‚Äî a _borderless_ overlay.
    

So from an operational standpoint:

- Each edge (branch, user, cloud gateway) enforces **consistent, granular policy**.
    
- Control and visibility are centralized.
    
- The ‚Äúborders‚Äù between enterprise, cloud, and Internet dissolve.
    

---

## üîê Security & control refinement

BWAN adds:

- **Contextual control:** policies based on _who_ or _what_ is connecting, not just IP/subnet.
    
- **Granular segmentation:** micro-segmentation ‚Äúinside‚Äù the fabric, often leveraging tags, groups, or SGTs (Security Group Tags).
    
- **Unified trust model:** integrates with Zero-Trust and SASE components to secure all edges equally.
    

So while SD-WAN gives you the _pipes_ and _orchestration_,  
**BWAN defines the rules of the road** ‚Äî security, access, and identity awareness ‚Äî across those pipes.

---

## üß† TL;DR

> BWAN ‚âà _Architectural ‚Äúwrapper‚Äù around SD-WAN_ that makes the WAN behave like a global, secure, full-mesh overlay ‚Äî where **policy, security, and identity** are uniformly enforced at every edge.

---

Would you like me to draw (or describe) a **logical diagram** showing how BWAN overlays and interacts with SD-WAN fabric layers? It‚Äôs often easier to visualize the wrapper model that way.

##### You said:

so if I already have Cisco SDWAN, it would be a relatively seamless process to integrate that with BWAN?

###### ChatGPT said:

Excellent ‚Äî that‚Äôs exactly the right way to think about it.  
And yes ‚Äî ‚úÖ if you **already have Cisco SD-WAN**, integrating **Borderless WAN (BWAN)** capabilities is **relatively seamless**, because Cisco _designed_ BWAN as a **natural architectural evolution** of its SD-WAN fabric within the **Cisco Borderless Network** and now **Cisco Secure Access (SASE)** frameworks.

Let‚Äôs unpack what ‚Äúrelatively seamless‚Äù actually means in practice:

---

## üß© 1. Why It‚Äôs Seamless

Your existing **Cisco SD-WAN (Viptela or IOS-XE SD-WAN)** already provides:

- Dynamic overlay tunnels and full-mesh capabilities
    
- Centralized orchestration via **vManage / vSmart / vBond**
    
- Segmentation and traffic steering
    
- API-driven automation and telemetry
    

These are **core building blocks** for a Borderless WAN.

When you ‚Äúextend‚Äù to BWAN, you‚Äôre not replacing this ‚Äî you‚Äôre **enriching** it by integrating:

- **Identity-driven access control** (Cisco ISE, Duo, or similar)
    
- **Unified security and cloud edge** (Cisco Umbrella, SIG, or SASE components)
    
- **Cloud and SaaS integration** (Cloud OnRamp for SaaS/IaaS)
    
- **Analytics and visibility** (ThousandEyes, DNA Center, or SecureX)
    

So instead of re-architecting, you‚Äôre **layering BWAN capabilities** on top of your existing SD-WAN fabric.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Integration Building Blocks

Here‚Äôs what that typically looks like step by step:

|Integration Area|Cisco Solution|What It Adds|
|---|---|---|
|**Identity & Policy Control**|Cisco ISE + SD-WAN segmentation|Context-aware, identity-driven access within the WAN fabric|
|**Cloud Security & SASE Edge**|Cisco Umbrella SIG or Cisco+ Secure Connect|Extends the SD-WAN fabric to Internet & cloud securely|
|**Zero Trust / Remote Access**|Cisco Duo + AnyConnect (or Secure Client)|Brings users into the BWAN fabric with consistent policies|
|**Cloud OnRamp**|Built into vManage|Direct optimization and policy-based routing to SaaS/IaaS|
|**Visibility & Assurance**|ThousandEyes + vAnalytics + DNA Center|Global visibility across all edges and fabrics|

All of these integrate natively with Cisco SD-WAN using APIs or policy extensions ‚Äî meaning **no major topology redesigns or forklift upgrades**.

---

## üîÑ 3. Migration Path Example

Here‚Äôs a practical evolution roadmap:

1. **Baseline:**  
    Fully functional Cisco SD-WAN (branches, DCs, and cloud)
    
2. **Phase 1 ‚Äì Security Integration:**  
    Integrate Cisco Umbrella SIG & ISE for identity-based policies.
    
3. **Phase 2 ‚Äì Cloud OnRamp:**  
    Extend SD-WAN fabric directly into Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud.
    
4. **Phase 3 ‚Äì Borderless Access:**  
    Incorporate remote/mobile users via Cisco+ Secure Connect (SASE).
    
5. **Phase 4 ‚Äì Unified Analytics:**  
    Add ThousandEyes/DNA Center for end-to-end BWAN visibility.
    

After this, your WAN effectively becomes **‚Äúborderless‚Äù** ‚Äî identity-driven, policy-consistent, and cloud-connected.

---

## üß† 4. Key Takeaway

> If you‚Äôre already running Cisco SD-WAN, you‚Äôre **60‚Äì70% of the way** to a Borderless WAN.  
> The remaining steps are mostly **integration and policy harmonization**, not infrastructure overhaul.

# Mojang Authentication
what service/port and ip/dns name does a minecraft server use to contact mojang authentication servers? How can I configure a Cisco Edge router to allow traffic to only that specific service?

###### ChatGPT said:

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what you asked: **which service/port and DNS name/IP the Minecraft (Java Edition) server uses to contact Mojang (or Microsoft‚Äôs) authentication/session servers**, and **how you could configure a Cisco Edge router (or similar) to allow ONLY that traffic**.

---

### What service/port/DNS does Minecraft use for authentication/session?

Here are the key facts:

- Minecraft (Java Edition) in ‚Äúonline-mode=true‚Äù will perform HTTP(s) calls to Mojang‚Äôs authentication/session infrastructure. For example:
    
    - The host `authserver.mojang.com` is used for login/refresh/validate. [restfulmc.cc+3Open Public APIs+3mojang-api-docs.gapple.pw+3](https://openpublicapis.com/api/mojang?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    - The host `sessionserver.mojang.com` is used by the server (and client) to verify sessions ‚Äî e.g., `hasJoined`, `join`, and profile retrieval. [GitHub Wiki Search Engine+2Open Public APIs+2](https://github-wiki-see.page/m/CosmoKotik/Minecraft-AuthSystem/wiki/Minecraft-auth-rest-api?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    - The host `api.mojang.com` is also used for lookup and profile services. [Netify+1](https://www.netify.ai/resources/hostnames/api.mojang.com?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
- The protocol is HTTPS (thus TCP port 443) for those services. For example one Reddit user states:
    
    > ‚Äúthe ports minecraft uses are tcp 443 for login, and tcp 25565 (configurable) for the game.‚Äù [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/kodjw8?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- The default server port for the Minecraft game itself is TCP port 25565 (when hosting a Java Edition server). [internet-security.com+1](https://internet-security.com/ports/port-25565-TCP.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- Regarding IP addresses: the DNS names above (e.g., `sessionserver.mojang.com`) resolve to a large number of IPs (Microsoft / Azure front door/CDN) rather than a fixed single IP. For example, `sessionserver.mojang.com` is ‚Äúassociated with approx. 119 IP addresses on Azure Front Door‚Äù. [Netify](https://www.netify.ai/resources/hostnames/sessionserver.mojang.com?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

**In summary**:

- Service to allow: HTTPS (TCP/443) outbound from your Minecraft server (or your host) to the DNS names: `authserver.mojang.com`, `sessionserver.mojang.com`, `api.mojang.com`, and possibly `api.minecraftservices.com` (the later being a newer endpoint).
    
- Service to allow inbound: If hosting a server for players, inbound on TCP port 25565 (unless you changed it) for the game traffic itself.
    
- Because the IPs are dynamic/large set (CDN) you should filter by DNS name or domain if possible, rather than by a fixed IP list.

### How to configure a Cisco Edge (router/firewall) to allow only that specific service

Assuming you have a Cisco Edge router/firewall (for example an edge Cisco ASA, or a Cisco ISR with ACLs, or possibly Cisco Meraki MX, etc) and you want to lock down traffic so that your Minecraft server only communicates with the required Mojang auth/session endpoints and no arbitrary internet access, here‚Äôs an outline of steps and configuration guidance:

#### Pre-work

1. Ensure your DNS resolution works properly for the domains above. The router or firewall must allow DNS queries so the hostnames can resolve.
    
2. You may want to identify the Minecraft server host‚Äôs IP (internal) and ensure NAT/port-forwarding is set for the game port (if players external to your LAN connect).
    
3. Determine whether your Minecraft server is making outgoing connections as part of authentication (yes it will) and which interface it uses.
    

#### Configuration outline (using Cisco ASA or similar syntax)

Here‚Äôs a sample approach (you‚Äôll adjust interface names, object names, etc):

`!

#### Key points / tips

- Use **FQDN network objects** if your Cisco device supports them (many newer ASA versions, Firepower, etc). This helps because Mojang‚Äôs IPs are many and change via CDN.
    
- If your device **does not support FQDN objects**, you‚Äôd need to approximate by allowing the known IP prefixes for Microsoft/Azure front-door/CDN as the services resolve. This is more fragile.
    
- Make sure DNS queries are allowed from the server so the names can resolve.
    
- Make sure NAT is configured for inbound game traffic if you host players from outside.
    
- You might also want to allow outbound DNS and perhaps NTP (UDP 123) depending on your server needs.
    
- Log and monitor outbound traffic: if you see the server trying to go to other destinations, you may have to expand the list (for example ancillary services like textures.minecraft.net, libraries.minecraft.net).
    
- Remember that the player game traffic (TCP 25565 inbound/outbound) is separate from the Mojang auth traffic. Don‚Äôt confuse the two.
    
- If you run multiple services on that host (Minecraft + other internet access), you may prefer to use a dedicated host or apply ACLs per host.

### Caveats & things to watch

- Because the Mojang auth/session servers are behind CDNs/Front-door networks, the IP addresses can change frequently (and vary by region). Relying purely on static IPs may cause authentication failures.
    
- Make sure you don‚Äôt inadvertently block other required endpoints: e.g., `textures.minecraft.net`, `assets.minecraft.net`, or `api.minecraftservices.com`. If your server (or clients connecting) need to fetch skins or other assets, you may need to allow those as well.
    
- If you use any proxies, VPNs or have unusual NAT, be sure the outbound DNS and HTTPS traffic is not blocked.
    
- If you ever switch your server to ‚Äúoffline-mode=true‚Äù (not recommended) you bypass authentication but that has other risks (security/trusted accounts).
    
- For very strict environments you could also enforce ‚Äúonly this server can talk out on 443 to those domains‚Äù and drop everything else.

##### You said:

what is Cisco ASA

###### ChatGPT said:

A **Cisco ASA** (Adaptive Security Appliance) is a family of **firewall and security devices** made by Cisco Systems. It‚Äôs one of Cisco‚Äôs most widely deployed network security platforms and is commonly used as an **edge firewall**, **VPN concentrator**, and **network security gateway**.

Here‚Äôs a simple breakdown üëá

---

### üß± What Cisco ASA Does

Cisco ASA acts as the **main security barrier** between your internal network (like your home or company LAN) and the internet.  
It can perform several key roles:

|Function|Description|
|---|---|
|**Firewall**|Controls which network traffic is allowed or blocked based on rules (Access Control Lists / ACLs).|
|**NAT (Network Address Translation)**|Translates private internal IP addresses to public ones for internet access.|
|**VPN (Virtual Private Network)**|Supports both site-to-site and remote-access VPNs using IPsec or SSL.|
|**Intrusion Prevention (IPS)**|Some ASA models include or integrate with Cisco‚Äôs Firepower services to detect and stop attacks.|
|**Routing & Network Segmentation**|Can route between networks and apply different security levels (inside, outside, DMZ, etc).|

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Typical Deployment

A common setup looks like this:

`Internet ‚Üî [Cisco ASA Firewall] ‚Üî Internal Network                        |                        ‚îî‚îÄ DMZ (e.g., Web or Minecraft Server)`

- The ASA filters **inbound** and **outbound** traffic.
    
- It decides what‚Äôs allowed (e.g., TCP port 25565 for Minecraft, HTTPS 443 for authentication).
    
- It can log and monitor connections for security analysis.
    

---

### üß© Versions and Models

Cisco ASA comes in different forms:

- **Hardware appliances** ‚Äî e.g., ASA 5506-X, 5512-X, 5525-X, etc.
    
- **Virtual appliance** ‚Äî e.g., ASAv, which runs in VMware, AWS, Azure, etc.
    
- **Firepower integration** ‚Äî newer ASAs can run **Firepower Threat Defense (FTD)** software for next-gen firewall features.
    

---

### üñ•Ô∏è Management Options

You can manage Cisco ASA via:

- **CLI (Command Line Interface)** ‚Äî through SSH, console, or Telnet.
    
- **ASDM (Adaptive Security Device Manager)** ‚Äî a graphical interface via web/Java.
    
- **Cisco FMC (Firepower Management Center)** ‚Äî if using Firepower/FTD.
    

---

### üí° In the Context of Your Question

If you have a **Cisco ASA as your edge router/firewall**, you can:

- Use it to **allow only Minecraft authentication traffic (HTTPS 443)** to Mojang‚Äôs domains.
    
- Block all other outbound internet access for that specific server.
    
- Control inbound access to your Minecraft server‚Äôs **game port 25565**.

Would you like me to show you what a **sample Cisco ASA configuration** would look like for a Minecraft server that only talks to Mojang‚Äôs authentication servers?

##### You said:

CLI for a Cisco Catalyst 8kv on SDWAN Mode running IOS XE

###### ChatGPT said:

Excellent ‚Äî you‚Äôre asking about **Cisco Catalyst 8000V (8Kv)** in **SD-WAN mode** (also known as **Cisco SD-WAN Edge**, running **IOS XE SD-WAN image**, not the classic IOS XE standalone mode).

Let‚Äôs clarify the context first, then I‚Äôll show you how the **CLI** works on that platform and how it differs from a traditional Cisco ASA or IOS router.

---

## üß± 1. What You‚Äôre Running

- **Device:** Cisco Catalyst 8000V (8Kv) ‚Äî a **virtual router** (VNF) that can run in VMware, KVM, AWS, Azure, etc.
    
- **Mode:** **SD-WAN mode** (not Autonomous). That means it‚Äôs managed by **vManage / vSmart / vBond** controllers.
    
- **Software:** **IOS XE SD-WAN (cEdge)** image, typically version 17.x or later.
    

When the router boots in SD-WAN mode, the CLI and command set are a bit different from traditional IOS XE.  
You‚Äôll mostly use:

- **`vshell`** ‚Äî Linux shell access.
    
- **`vmanage` / `vsmart` / `vbond`** connectivity verification.
    
- **`show sdwan ...`** commands.
    

---

## üß∞ 2. CLI Basics in SD-WAN Mode

### Enter privileged EXEC mode

`router> enable router#`

### Common SD-WAN Show Commands

|Command|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`show sdwan system status`|Shows controller connections, control status, and certificate status.|
|`show sdwan control connections`|Lists active control connections to vSmart, vBond, vManage.|
|`show sdwan bfd sessions`|Displays data-plane tunnels between sites.|
|`show sdwan interface`|Lists WAN interfaces and their status.|
|`show sdwan omp peers`|Shows OMP (Overlay Management Protocol) peerings with vSmart.|
|`show sdwan software`|Shows current and available software versions.|
|`show sdwan version`|Displays SD-WAN software version.|
|`show sdwan running-config`|Displays the SD-WAN configuration (similar to `show running-config`).|

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Config Mode in SD-WAN

Unlike traditional IOS XE, you **don‚Äôt configure directly from CLI** in production SD-WAN mode ‚Äî you push configs from **vManage**.  
However, you _can_ use local config mode for testing or bootstrap before onboarding to vManage.

### Example: entering config mode

`router# config-transaction router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet1 router(config-if)# ip address 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.0 router(config-if)# no shutdown router(config-if)# exit router(config)# commit`

This uses a **transactional configuration model** ‚Äî you must `commit` changes.

---

## üåê 4. Example: Allowing Specific Outbound Traffic (Conceptually)

While ASA uses ACLs, on SD-WAN you manage **policies** via vManage/vSmart.  
To allow only Minecraft authentication traffic from a hosted server behind your 8Kv, you‚Äôd typically:

1. Create a **Localized Data Policy** (ACL-like) in **vManage**.
    
2. Match:
    
    - Source: your Minecraft server LAN IP.
        
    - Destination FQDNs: `authserver.mojang.com`, `sessionserver.mojang.com`, etc. (using FQDN objects if supported).
        
    - Destination port: `443`.
        
3. Action: `permit`.
    
4. Then `deny` everything else.
    

CLI reference example for a **local data policy** if you were to view or apply it locally:

`show sdwan policy local`

or (for config inspection)

`show sdwan running-config policy`

---

## üß© 5. Useful Hybrid Commands

|Command|Description|
|---|---|
|`show platform software sdwan control`|Details of SD-WAN control processes.|
|`vshell`|Drops you into Linux shell.|
|`request platform software sdwan software upgrade`|Trigger image upgrade.|
|`show ip route`|Shows routing table (still available).|
|`show int description`|Shows interface summary.|

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª 6. Example Bootstrap Config (for lab/testing)

If you were onboarding manually before connecting to vManage:

`system  host-name C8kv-Edge1  system-ip 10.10.10.10  site-id 100  organization-name "MyOrg"  vbond 203.0.113.1 ! interface GigabitEthernet1  ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0  no shutdown  tunnel-interface   encapsulation ipsec   color biz-internet restrict   allow-service all   exit  commit`

---

## üßæ 7. Summary

|Feature|ASA|Catalyst 8Kv (SD-WAN mode)|
|---|---|---|
|OS|ASA/FTD|IOS XE SD-WAN (cEdge)|
|Management|CLI/ASDM|vManage GUI or CLI (limited)|
|Policies|ACLs / Security Policies|Centralized SD-WAN Policies|
|FQDN Filtering|Supported (limited)|Supported via vManage Local Policy|
|Typical Ports|Custom / Any|Application-aware via DPI|

---

If you tell me:

- whether your **8Kv is managed by vManage** or standalone in **CLI-only mode**, and
    
- what **traffic control goal** you have (e.g., restrict Minecraft server outbound to Mojang authentication servers),
    

‚Ä¶I can show you the exact CLI or vManage workflow for that case (with syntax and policy definitions).

Would you like me to generate that?

##### You said:

configure that mojang authentication service using ASA through CLI on the edge router mentioned above

###### ChatGPT said:

Got it ‚Äî you‚Äôre running a **Cisco Catalyst 8000V (C8Kv)** in **SD-WAN mode**, and you want to **configure it (through CLI)** so that your Minecraft server can **only reach Mojang‚Äôs authentication servers**, similar to what you‚Äôd do with a Cisco ASA.

However, there‚Äôs an important distinction here:

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Point ‚Äî ASA vs. C8Kv (SD-WAN)

The **Cisco ASA** and the **C8Kv in SD-WAN mode** are **very different platforms**:

|Feature|ASA|C8Kv (SD-WAN mode)|
|---|---|---|
|Software|ASA OS or Firepower (FTD)|IOS XE SD-WAN (cEdge)|
|Config via|Local CLI|vManage (centralized)|
|ACL style|`access-list` commands|Data-policy (centralized)|
|FQDN filtering|Supported (with DNS resolution)|Supported (in vManage, not local CLI)|
|Management|Local or ASDM|vManage ‚Üí pushed policies|

So, **you cannot configure a classic ASA-style ACL directly** in SD-WAN mode ‚Äî those are managed via **vManage policies**, not the local CLI.

If your C8Kv were in **autonomous mode** (classic IOS XE), you _could_ use ASA-like ACLs directly on the CLI.  
But since it‚Äôs **SD-WAN mode**, you‚Äôll handle filtering via **Localized Data Policy** (either in vManage GUI or CLI transaction).

---

## ‚úÖ What You _Can_ Do via CLI (SD-WAN Mode)

You can still **define a local data policy** on the 8Kv to only permit HTTPS traffic to Mojang authentication servers (by IP or FQDN).

Below is a **CLI example** you can adapt.

---

### üß± Step 1: Enter configuration mode

`C8kv# config-transaction`

---

### üß© Step 2: Define Localized Data Policy

`C8kv(config)# policy local-data-policy MOJANG-FILTER  ! Match Minecraft server as source (internal host) C8kv(config-local-data-policy)# sequence 10 C8kv(config-local-data-policy-seq)# match source-ip 192.168.1.50/32 C8kv(config-local-data-policy-seq)# match destination-port 443 C8kv(config-local-data-policy-seq)# match destination-fqdn authserver.mojang.com C8kv(config-local-data-policy-seq)# match destination-fqdn sessionserver.mojang.com C8kv(config-local-data-policy-seq)# match destination-fqdn api.minecraftservices.com C8kv(config-local-data-policy-seq)# action accept C8kv(config-local-data-policy-seq)# exit  ! Deny all other outbound traffic from that host C8kv(config-local-data-policy)# sequence 20 C8kv(config-local-data-policy-seq)# match source-ip 192.168.1.50/32 C8kv(config-local-data-policy-seq)# action drop C8kv(config-local-data-policy-seq)# exit  C8kv(config-local-data-policy)# exit`

---

### üß≠ Step 3: Apply the Policy to the Correct Interface

Assume your **LAN interface** is `GigabitEthernet1` (where your Minecraft server connects):

`C8kv(config)# apply-policy local-data-policy MOJANG-FILTER interface GigabitEthernet1`

---

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Commit and Save

`C8kv(config)# commit C8kv(config)# end`

---

### üß∞ Step 5: Verification

Check the policy is applied:

`show sdwan policy local`

Check traffic matches (once traffic flows):

`show sdwan policy statistics local-data-policy`

---

## üåê Note on FQDN Support

If FQDN matching isn‚Äôt supported in your current IOS XE SD-WAN version, you can:

1. Temporarily allow `tcp/443` to `*.mojang.com` domains via wildcard (if your controller supports it), or
    
2. Resolve the current IPs of Mojang‚Äôs servers and use them as `match destination-ip <ip/subnet>` (less ideal since they change often).
    

---

## üßæ Summary

‚úÖ You can:

- Restrict your Minecraft server to only reach Mojang authentication endpoints.
    
- Do it locally through a **localized data policy**.
    
- Manage via CLI or vManage GUI.
    

üö´ You cannot:

- Use classic `access-list` syntax (that‚Äôs for ASA or IOS XE ‚Äúautonomous‚Äù mode).
    

---

Would you like me to show the **same configuration but for IOS XE standalone mode** (non-SD-WAN), in case you ever run the C8Kv as a traditional router/firewall? That version uses ASA-style ACLs directly.

Make sure you don‚Äôt inadvertently block other required endpoints: e.g., textures.minecraft.net, assets.minecraft.net, or api.minecraftservices.com. If your server (or clients connecting) need to fetch skins or other assets, you may need to allow those as well. What are these used for?

###### ChatGPT said:

Excellent question ‚Äî those extra **Minecraft-related domains** you mentioned (`textures.minecraft.net`, `assets.minecraft.net`, and `api.minecraftservices.com`) are part of Mojang/Microsoft‚Äôs broader infrastructure for **authentication, player profiles, and game assets**.

They serve different but complementary purposes to the main authentication servers (`authserver.mojang.com` and `sessionserver.mojang.com`).

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what each does üëá

---

### üß© `api.minecraftservices.com`

**Purpose:**  
This is the **newer unified API endpoint** for Microsoft account‚Äìbased Minecraft authentication and profile management.

**Used for:**

- Account and profile verification (post-Microsoft migration).
    
- Retrieving player UUIDs and profile data.
    
- Handling token validation for players logging in with Microsoft accounts (OAuth2-based).
    
- Session joins (similar to older `sessionserver.mojang.com` but under Microsoft‚Äôs domain).
    

**If blocked:**  
Players may fail to log in, refresh tokens, or appear offline even though they have valid Microsoft/Minecraft accounts.

**Typical traffic:**

- Outbound HTTPS (TCP 443)
    
- API paths like `/authentication/login_with_xbox`, `/entitlements/mcstore`, `/minecraft/profile`
    

---

### üé® `textures.minecraft.net`

**Purpose:**  
Hosts **player skin and cape textures** ‚Äî the small PNG files that represent each user‚Äôs custom character appearance.

**Used for:**

- Loading and caching player skins and capes (both on clients and servers with skin lookup enabled).
    
- Providing texture URLs referenced in player profile JSON data.
    

**If blocked:**

- Players will appear as the default **Steve/Alex** skin.
    
- No custom skins or capes will load for anyone (including yourself) when viewed in-game.
    

**Typical traffic:**

- Outbound HTTPS (TCP 443)
    
- Requests like `https://textures.minecraft.net/texture/<hash>`
    

---

### üì¶ `assets.minecraft.net`

**Purpose:**  
Hosts **static game assets** such as sounds, language files, textures, and other content used by the Minecraft launcher and sometimes by servers for verification or version data.

**Used for:**

- Game launcher downloading version JSONs and resource files.
    
- Resource fetching during updates or asset verification.
    

**If blocked:**

- Game clients might fail to update or validate properly.
    
- Some resource-dependent features (like version synchronization) could fail for players connecting to your server.
    

**Typical traffic:**

- Outbound HTTPS (TCP 443)
    
- Accesses version or asset JSONs like `https://assets.minecraft.net/<version>/...`
    

---

### üí° Summary Table

|Domain|Function|Required for|Effect if Blocked|
|---|---|---|---|
|`authserver.mojang.com`|Login validation (legacy Mojang accounts)|Authentication|Players cannot log in|
|`sessionserver.mojang.com`|Session join verification|Multiplayer join|"Invalid session" errors|
|`api.minecraftservices.com`|Microsoft account authentication & entitlements|Login (Microsoft)|Login/token failures|
|`textures.minecraft.net`|Player skins & capes|In-game skin display|Default Steve/Alex skin only|
|`assets.minecraft.net`|Game/launcher assets|Launcher & updates|Missing assets / update failures|

---

### ‚úÖ Recommendation (Firewall / ACL-wise)

If you‚Äôre restricting outbound HTTPS for your Minecraft server host, **allow at least these domains** to ensure full functionality:

`authserver.mojang.com sessionserver.mojang.com api.minecraftservices.com textures.minecraft.net assets.minecraft.net api.mojang.com`

You can keep it **HTTPS only (TCP 443)** ‚Äî no other ports are required.
