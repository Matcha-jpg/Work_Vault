What is BWAN

How can we integrate SDWAN With BWAN?

Is the "device" in "AFRL RAPIDS SIL" something we need to connect to? I.e. virtual desktops?
If the answer is yes to above, can we deploy a Cisco Virtual Router C8kv and link it to the SDWAN 

Infrastructure to have a hybrid SDWAN-BWAN infrastructure where we use the link to the SDWAN to get to the BWAN?
